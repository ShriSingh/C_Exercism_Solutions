This is my repository containing solutions to problems and challenges in Exercism through the C track. 
I'm trying brush up and master my C syntax and programming skills through this free, community driven coding platform. 
Although I've posted my best solutions to the respective problems(mentioned as the names of the files) for everyone's reference, 
I'm open to suggestions and improvements to my code.
